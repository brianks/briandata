If you are installing Stata from a disk image that is located in your Downloads folder, you may be presented with the prompt "Do you want to move the package 'Stata 14' to the Trash?" after clicking on the <strong>Close</strong> button. Stata's installer is asking for permission to move its disk image (Stata14.dmg) to the Trash. You should keep a copy of the installer by clicking on the <strong>Keep</strong> button in case you need to run the installer again in the future.
