* Exercise 
* Do the following using STATA: 
/* (try to do these exercises on your own.  If you get stuck, 
a list of commands showing one way to do each of these is included in the file
http://students.washington.edu/chutter/Intro_to_STATA/review_session10_dofile.txt)*/

* 1. Set your default directory
* cd f:/stataclass

* 2. Start a log file (have it be a text file, rather than a .smcl file)
capture log close
log using session9_review.log, replace

/* 3. Open a new do file, and type command in the do file, rather 
than on the command line.*/

* 4. Open the blood pressure dataset in long form from the class website 
webuse bplong, clear

* 5. Perform a two-sample unpaired t-test comparing before and after.
ttest bp, by(when)

* 6. Reshape the data to have the two bp observations per individual in the same row.
reshape wide bp, i(patient) j(when)

* 7. Perform the paired t-test.  Note the differences between the paired and unpaired t-tests.
ttest bp1=bp2

* 8. Perform the paired t-test separately for males and females.
bys sex: ttest bp1=bp2

* 9. Perform the paired t-test separately for people under 45 and for people 46 and over.
recode agegrp 1=0 2 3=1, gen(over45)
label define over45_lab 0 "45 and under" 1 "46 and over"
label values over45 over45_lab
tab agegrp over45
bys over45: ttest bp1=bp2

/*10. Make a nice table in Microsoft Word that has the mean, standard deviation, 
median, 25th% and 75% for blood pressure before and blood pressure after, 
separately for males and females. Have all numbers rounded to 2 digits 
after the decimal place. */ 
tabstat bp1 bp2, stat(n mean sd q) col(stat)  by(sex)  format(%9.2f) long
/* then use "copy table" in Stata, insert into word and use 
Table->Convert->Convert Text to Table in Word"*/

* 11. Performed a two-sample unpaired t-test comparing the bp1 value for males and females.
ttest bp1, by(sex)

* 12. Close your log.
capture log close
