* Created by Carolyn Hutter on October 8th
* Commands for doing some basic graphs

* open dataset
use "http://students.washington.edu/chutter/Intro_to_STATA/toy_data.dta", clear

* Create a scatter plot of age and ht
graph twoway scatter age ht

* Histogram of height
histogram ht, bin(5)

/* Histogram of height with males, females and total 
	with 10 categories
	in separate panels all in one column */
hist ht, bin(10) by(sex, total c(1)) freq

* Bar chart of mean age over case status
graph bar age, over(case)

* make the graph more informative by labeling the variable case
capture label drop case // note use of capture
label define case 0 "control" 1 "case"
label values case case
label variable case "Case/control indicator"
graph bar age, over(case)

* Make graph more informative by adding titles
graph bar age , over(case) /// HIGHLIGHT THIS LINE AND 2 LINES BELOW 
	b1title(case status) ytitle(Mean age in years) ///  
	title(Mean age by case status) // END HIGHLIGHTING HERE

* Same graph, but with median age, rather than mean age
graph bar (median)age , over(case) /// HIGHLIGHT THIS LINE AND 2 LINES BELOW 
	b1title(case status) ytitle(Median age in years) ///  
	title(Median age by case status) // END HIGHLIGHTING HERE


* Box plot of ht,with males and females on same graph
graph box ht, over(sex)

* Box plot of ht, with males and females in separate panels
graph box ht, by(sex)

/* Box plot of ht, with males and females in separate panels 
	and a third panel for the total group */
graph box ht, by(sex, total)

* Same graph, but with the three panels in a row
graph box ht, by(sex, total col(3))

* same graph, but under differnt schemes
graph box ht, by(sex, total col(3)) scheme(s1mono)
graph box ht, by(sex, total col(3)) scheme(s2mono)

* save the graph as a windows metafile
graph export box_plot.wmf, as(wmf) replace
