* Exercise:
/* Do the following using STATA.  
(Try to do them on your own. If you get stuck, a list of the commands 
showing one way to do each of these is included in the 
file http://students.washington.edu/chutter/Intro_to_STATA/review_session6_dofile.txt) */

* 1. Set your default directory
cd f:\stataclass

* 2. Start a log file (have it be a text file, rather than a smcl file) 

capture log close
log using session6_review.txt, text replace

/* 3. Open the dataset new_toy_data.dta (this is a STATA 10 dataset.  
If you are using an earlier version of STATA you will need to insheet toy_data.csv)*/

use http://students.washington.edu/chutter/Intro_to_STATA/new_toy_data.dta, clear

* 4. Open a new do file, and type commands in the do file, rather than on the command line. 

/* 5. Generate a new variable called "bpratio" that is the ratio of the average systolic 
blood pressure and average diastolic blood pressure for each individual 
(hint: as a start, use the command:
egen avgsys=rowmean(sys1 sys2 sys3) 
to get average systolic blood pressure for an individual).  */

egen avgsys=rowmean(sys1 sys2 sys3)
egen avgdias=rowmean(dias1 dias2 dias3)
gen bpratio=avgsys/avgdias
label variable bpratio "ratio of avg systolic bp and average diastolic bp)

/* 6. Do a two-sample (unpaired) test to test if the mean value of 
the variable bpratio differs between cases and controls.  
(Note, if you are using an older version of the toy dataset, you might want to label 
the values of the variable case to make your output easier to interpret). */

ttest bpratio, by(case) unequal

* 7. Generate an indicator variable that has the value 0 for people 50 and under and the value 1 for people over 50.

recode age 50/max=1 min/50=0, gen(over50)
* note, in this order people who are exactly 50 will have over50=0.
label variable over50 "indicator that people are over 50 years of age"
label  define over50_label 0 "<=50 years" 1 ">50 years"
label values over50 over50_label

tabstat age, by(over50) stat(min max)


* 8. Do a chisquared test to see if there is evidence in this dataset for an association between case/control status and being over50.

tab over50 case, chi

* close your log
