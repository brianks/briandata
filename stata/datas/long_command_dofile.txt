* Created by Carolyn Hutter on October 8th
* Demonstrates ways to format long command lines in Stata dofiles



* sometimes commands in Stata are very long. For example:
infile seqnbr subjid age  fev height sex smoke using "http://www.emersonstatistics.com/courses/Formal/b517/fev.txt", clear

* this can be hard to read.  So it is useful to split it up over multiple lines.

******************************************************************************

* you can make use of notation that was introduced in discussing comments
/* Note, you need a space before and after the three slashes "///", 
	but not the slash asterisks */

infile seqnbr subjid age  fev height sex smoke using ///
	"http://www.emersonstatistics.com/courses/Formal/b517/fev.txt" ///
 	, clear

* or
infile seqnbr subjid age  fev height sex smoke using/*
	*/"http://www.emersonstatistics.com/courses/Formal/b517/fev.txt"/*
 	*/, clear

******************************************************************************

* you can also use #delimit to change the end of line delimiter
/* This is best used when you plan to run/do an entire do file.  
	If you are highlighting sections of the do file to run, you will need to
	also highlight the #delimit line each time */
#delimit ;
infile seqnbr subjid age  fev height sex smoke using 
	"http://www.emersonstatistics.com/courses/Formal/b517/fev.txt" 
 	, clear;


#delimit cr; 
* this restores the delimiter to a carriage return (cr)

* try the above highlighting and doing everything from "#delimit" to ", clear;"
* try again only highlighting from "infile" to ", clear;" and note error
