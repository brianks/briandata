/* Do the following using STATA:
(try to do these exercises on your own.  If you get stuck, a list of commands 
showing one way to do each of these is included in the file
http://students.washington.edu/chutter/Intro_to_STATA/review_session8_dofile.txt) */

* 1. Set your default directory
cd e:/stataclass

* 2. Start a log file (have it be a text file, rather than a .smcl file)
capture log close
log using review_session8.log, replace

* 3. Open a new do file, and type command in the do file, rather than on the command line.
* 4. Open the new_toy_data dataset
insheet using "http://students.washington.edu/chutter/Intro_to_STATA/new_toy_data.csv", clear

/* 5. Generate a new variable called sysavg that takes the average of the three systolic blood pressure 
values for each person. */
egen sysavg=rowmean(sys1 sys2 sys3)

/* 6. Generate a new variable called highbp that is an indicator variable 
with the value 0 if sysavg<140 and 1 if sysavg>=140. */
recode sysavg min/140=0 140/max=1, gen(highbp)

* 7. Label the variable highbp and the values of the variable highbp.
label variable highbp "Indicator of average systolic blood pressure >=140"
label define highbp_lab 0 "<140" 1 ">=140"
label values highbp highbp_lab

/* 8. Assume this data came from a case control study.  Find the odds ratio 
for the association between high blood pressure and case status. */
cc case highbp

* 9. What is the PAR% for the association between high blood pressure and case status.
cc case highbp
* note, Stata labels the PAR% as " Attr. frac. pop"  

/* 10. The following table is from page 230 of Koepsell and Weiss:

Exposure	Cases	Controls	Odds Ratio
Yes	150	75	
			3.0
No	150	225	
	300	300	
Use STATA to confirm that the odds ratio of 3.0 is correct. */
cci 150 150 75 225

* 11. Close your log
