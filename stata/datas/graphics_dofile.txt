* Created by Carolyn Hutter on October 8th

* open dataset
insheet using "http://students.washington.edu/chutter/Intro_to_STATA/toy_data.csv", clear
* make graphs in black and white
set scheme s1mono

* Create a scatter plot of age and ht
graph twoway scatter age ht

* Histogram of height
histogram ht, bin(5)

* Box plot of mean age over case status
graph box age, over(case)

* make the graph more informative by labeling the variable case
label define case 0 "control" 1 "case"
label values case case
label variable case "Case/control indicator"
graph box age, over(case)

* Make graph more informative by adding titles
graph box age , over(case)	b1title(case status) ytitle(Mean age in years) 	title(Mean age by case status) 

* Box plot of ht,with males and females on same graph
graph box ht, over(sex)
* Box plot of ht, with males and females in separate panels
graph box ht, by(sex)
* Box plot of ht, with males and females in separate panels and a third panel for the total group *
graph box ht, by(sex, total)
* Same graph, but with the three panels in a row
graph box ht, by(sex, total col(3))

* a more complicated graph. Because of its length, I used #delimit and wrote it over multiple lines.
#delimit ;
scatter ht age if sex=="M", jitter(5) msymbol(s) yvarlabel("Males") mcolor(blue)
	|| lowess ht age if sex=="M", lcolor(blue)
	|| scatter ht age if sex=="F", jitter(5) msymbol(o) yvarlabel("Females") mcolor(pink)
	|| lowess ht age if sex=="F", lcolor(pink)
	title("here is the title") ytitle("Here is the Y-axis title") legend(subtitle("Legend"));
