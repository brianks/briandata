/* Exercise:
Do the following using STATA:
(try to do these exercises on your own.  If you get stuck, a list of commands showing one way to do each of these is included in the file
http://students.washington.edu/chutter/Intro_to_STATA/review_session9_dofile.txt)
*/

*1. Set your default directory
cd f:/stataclass

* 2. Start a log file (have it be a text file, rather than a .smcl file)
capture log close
log using session9_review.log, replace

/* 3. Open a new do file, and type command in the do file, rather 
than on the command line.*/

* 4. Open the auto dataset from STATA website
webuse auto, clear
* 5. Create a scatter plot of car weight vs length 
scatter weight length, scheme(s1mono)

* 6. Generate the same graph, but superimpose a fitted line
scatter weight length || lfit weight length, scheme(s1mono)

/* 7. Perform linear regression to compare the relationship between 
weight (as outcome variable) and length (as predictor variable) */
regress weight length

/* 8. Perform linear regression to compare the relationship between 
weight (as outcome variable) and the dichotomous variable foreign 
(as predictor variable).  Compare these results to those of a 
t-test comparing the mean weight of domestic and foreign cars. */
regress weight foreign
ttest weight, by(foreign)
/* 9. Generate a new variable called "heavycar" that takes 
the value of 0 for cars that are less than the median weight 
of cars in the dataset and 1 for cars that are the median 
weight or heavier.  Label this variable and values of this variable. */
sum weight, detail
gen heavycar=0 if weight<r(p50)
replace heavycar=1 if weight>=r(p50)
label variable heavycar "Indicator that car is above median weight"
label define heavy_lab 0 "less than median weight" 1 "at or above median weight"
label values heavycar heavy_lab
/* 10. Perform logistic regression to compare the relationship
 between the variable heavycar (as outcome variable) and the 
dichotomous variable foreign (as predictor variable).  
Compare these results to the odds ratio obtained using the cc command.*/
logistic heavycar foreign
cc heavycar foreign
